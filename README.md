Exploring data from the Wikipedia "Core Biographies" WikiProject

Starting out, the most approachable part of this data to work with is likely the "Occupation" column. This will provide an idea of what types of roles have had a lasting impact on later events in history.

Another aspect of this data to explore is whether the amount of each occupation relative to each other has changed over time. For example, perhaps recent history shows more of one type of occupation than in the past, and less of an occupation that was more common in earlier history.

Additional considerations include: this list is selective, determining who were "core" figures of history is subjective, and the list may tend to be Eurocentric, not representing the history of all regions throughout the world.

In order to work with the "Date of Birth" and "Date of Death" fields, the data in those rows will need to be cleaned to create a standard formatting.
